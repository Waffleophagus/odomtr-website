# Odomtr Privacy Policy

### Last Updated: August 23, 2025

Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how Odomtr ("we," "us,"
"our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile
application (the "App"). We've tried to keep it simple and clear. I am actively
avoiding using overly complex language and want to keep it short and sweet.

## What Information We Collect

1. **Images You Provide:**
   - When you use our App, you might give us access to images from your device
     or take new ones using the App.
   - We need these images for the App to work as intended â€“ for example, to
     extract the cost and amount of gas you filled up in your car to make it
     such that you do not have to fill that out yourself.

2. **Information from Your Images (like text):**
   - To provide some features, we need to "read" or process the content of the
     images you provide. For example, we might extract text from an image (this
     is often called Optical Character Recognition or OCR).

3. **Usage Information (Analytics):**
   - We collect some information automatically about how you use the App. This
     helps us understand what features are popular, how the App is performing,
     and if there are any problems we need to fix.
   - This might include things like which features you use, how often you use
     them, general device information (like operating system type), and crash
     reports if something goes wrong. This information is generally anonymous or
     aggregated and doesn't directly identify you.
4. **Basic information needed to run the app:**
   - Things like your email, and other data you provide about your car are
     stored on our servers. This is needed to enable functionality like sharing
     an account with another person or getting a new device.

**How We Use Your Information**

1. **To Make the App Work for You:**
   - The main reason we use your images and the information from them and the
     information you provide is to provide the features and services of the App.

2. **To Improve Our App:**
   - We use the anonymous usage information to understand how people are using
     our App, to identify problems, and to make the App better and easier to
     use.

**How We Share Your Information**

1. **With Service Providers (for things like OCR):**
   - Sometimes, we need help from other companies to provide parts of our
     service. For example, to extract text (OCR) from the images you provide,
     **we may send these images to a specialized third-party service.** (At the
     time of writing we are mainly using Google Gemini)
     - **Location Data in Images:** We know that images can sometimes contain
       location data (like GPS coordinates embedded in the photo). The built in camera within the app does NOT gather any exif data intentionally.
        Our goal is to protect your location privacy when using these external services.

2. **With Analytics Partners:**
   - We may share the anonymous or aggregated usage data (that doesn't
     personally identify you) with partners who help us analyze how our App is
     being used. This helps us improve the App. This is way more about "When the
     app crashed, sending the error message to a server so I can fix it" and
     less tracking you in any way. The kind of information from this is entirely
     about making the app better.

3. **If Required by Law:**
   - We may share your information if we are legally required to do so, such as
     in response to a court order or other legal process.

**Data Security** We take reasonable steps to protect your information. However,
no system is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your
information.

**Your Choices** You can choose not to provide images to the App, but this will
likely mean you can't use some or all of its features. You can usually control
app permissions (like access to your photos or camera) through your device's
settings.

**Changes to This Policy** We may update this privacy policy from time to time.
If we make significant changes, we'll let you know by posting the new policy in
the App or through other communication.

handle your information, please contact us at: privacy@matt.campbells.place
